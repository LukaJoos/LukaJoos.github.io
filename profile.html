          Heyo! I'm luka, a first year ICT student at HZ University of Applied Sciences. Some information about myself:
          I live in Middelburg, Zeeland. And am currently 22 years of age.<br>
          In my free time I enjoy gaming, primarily sim racing (think of games such as the Formula 1 series and iRacing). 
          Besides racing game I also enjoy valorant and some indie games.<br>
          Next to gaming I also really like to travel and explore new places, both in and outside of europe. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So coming back to me liking to travel, in these past couple of years I have visited quite a couple of nice spots, these being:
          <ul>
            <li>Finland</li>
            <li>New York City</li>
            <li>Seattle</li>
            <li>Thailand</li>
            <li>New Zealand</li>
            <li>And more..</li>
          </ul>
          Most of my trips were between 1 and 2 weeks long. However Seattle-Thailand was a 3 Month solo trip, this trip was mostly to "reset" myself as that past year was a mess. During this trip I got to stay with family who I didn't know before this trip
