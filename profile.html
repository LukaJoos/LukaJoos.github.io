      <p class="personal">
        Heyo! I'm luka, a first year ICT student at HZ University of Applied Sciences. Some information about myself:
        I live in Middelburg, Zeeland. And am currently 22 years of age.<br>
        In my free time I enjoy gaming, primarily sim racing (think of games such as the Formula 1 series and
        iRacing).
        Besides racing game I also enjoy valorant and some indie games.<br>
        Next to gaming I also really like to travel and explore new places, both in and outside of europe.

          So coming back to me liking to travel, in these past couple of years I have visited quite a couple of nice
          spots, these being:
        </p>
        <ul class="travel">
          <li>Finland</li>
          <li>New York City</li>
          <li>Seattle</li>
          <li>Thailand</li>
          <li>New Zealand</li>
          <li>And more..</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="travel">
          Most of my trips were between 1 and 2 weeks long. However Seattle-Thailand was a 3 Month solo trip, this
          trip
          was mostly to "reset" myself as that past year was a bit of a mess. During this trip I got to stay with
          family
          who I
          didn't know before this trip, they were very hospitable and gave me many recommendations to do. After
          staying
          with them for 2 months I continued my travels to Thailand where I did a 4-week long International Bartending
          Course, this was an amazing experience where I learned a lot, not just in bartending but also personal
          development.
