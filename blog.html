                <h3>Study Choice</h3>
                <p>The way I decided on this study is purely by seeing what HZ had to offer. I knew I wanted to go to HZ
                    but
                    just wasn't sure on which study to do. This as I had done 2 previous MBO studies neither of which I
                    finished, so basically I had no clue where my interest was. After being in New Zealand for a little
                    while I knew I wanted to work towards a goal of moving there at some point, looking at the study
                    fields
                    again ICT really spoke to me as I have a friend who works in the ICT, and heard some good reviews on
                    it.

                <h3>1 in 4 ICT workers switched jobs or employers</h3>
                <p>In the past 12 months one in four employed ICT professionals switched jobs or changed employers.
                    Where
                    the mobility of ICT professionals has been stable in recent years, in the past year this has
                    increased
                    significantly whereas loyalty to their own manager/employer has decreased. Currently the number of
                    ICT
                    workers in the Netherlands is around 600.000 and is expected to grow to 900.000 by 2030. Even with
                    this
                    growth the demand for and scarcity of ICT workers remain high. This due to the increase in
                    self-employed
                    ICT professionals. <a
