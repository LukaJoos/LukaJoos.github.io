                The way I decided on this study is purely by seeing what HZ had to offer. I knew that I wanted to go to
                HZ but the biggest question was 'what studyfield do I see myself doing?'. This was a very tough question
                for myself to answer as I have previously done 2 MBO studies, both of which I didn't complete. Knowing
                my goal is to eventually move to New Zealand and seeing what HZ has to offer I decided to dig deeper
                into finding out what the study ICT had to offer, I did this by assessing the HZ page and also by asking
                a 4th year student. He kindly agreed to tell me some more about what the study entails to give me a
                better point of view of what to expect, this conversation made me sure I wanted to pursue a career
                within the ICT field.
