            <h3>1 in 4 ICT workers switched jobs or employers</h3>
            <p>In the past 12 months one in four employed ICT professionals switched jobs or changed employers.
                Where
                the mobility of ICT professionals has been stable in recent years, in the past year this has
                increased
                significantly whereas loyalty to their own manager/employer has decreased. Currently the number of
                ICT
                workers in the Netherlands is around 600.000 and is expected to grow to 900.000 by 2030. Even with
                this
                growth the demand for and scarcity of ICT workers remain high. This due to the increase in
                self-employed
                ICT professionals. <a class="link"
